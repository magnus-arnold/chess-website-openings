            <u><h4>Giuoco Piano</h4></u>
            <p>The most popular variation of the Italian Game is the Giuoco Piano, which starts after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5. The name of this line is an Italian expression that can translate to "soft game" or "slow game," 
                an indication that this variation often leads to positional games. 
                Despite its name, White can force a more open game by playing 5.d4 and entering the Center Attack variation.

            <u><h4>Giuoco Pianissimo</h4></u>
            <p>The Giuoco Pianissimo, as the name suggests, tends to lead to a "very slow game." 
                The d2-d3 push characterizes this variation and can happen either through 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.d3 or through 
                1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3. 
                With this variation, White keeps the center closed and favors a more positional game.</p>

                <u><h4>Evans Gambit</h4></u>
                <p>Popularized by Captain W.D. Evans and used extensively by Paul Morphy, The Evans Gambit is suitable for the aggressive player. 
                    White gives up a wing pawn to develop quickly and create a dangerous attack on the enemy king. 
                    This variation adds spice to the slower Giuoco Piano after the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4. 
                    Although not common at the highest levels, the Evans Gambit is one of the best-scoring lines among beginner and intermediate players.
